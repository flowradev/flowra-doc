## What is Flowra?

Flowra is an **AI-powered platform** for building agents, workflows, and integrations. You use it to create AI agents and automations that can call thousands of ready-made tools (Slack, Google, calendars, databases, and more) or your own custom tools — all through a single API and dashboard.

Flowra gives you:

- **20,000+ tools** — From any major API to your custom tool, grouped into toolkits (e.g. Slack, Gmail, Airtable).
- **Workflows & agents** — Orchestrate steps, run automations, and build AI agents that use these tools.
- **Triggers** — Run workflows on a schedule or when events happen.
- **Auth & connections** — OAuth, API keys, and connected accounts so tools can access third-party services securely.
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol server so MCP clients (Cursor, Claude, etc.) can use your project’s tools and context.
- **Knowledge / RAG** — Add files and URLs for retrieval-augmented generation in your agents.

You manage tools, auth configs, triggers, and connected accounts via the **Flowra API**, and you build and run workflows and agents in the **Flowra Dashboard**. Everything is tied to a **project** and secured with **API keys**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key terms">
    - **Project** — A workspace in Flowra. API keys and resources (tools, auth configs, triggers, connected accounts) belong to a project.
    - **Tool** — A single operation (e.g. send Slack message, create calendar event). Tools are grouped into **toolkits** (e.g. Slack, Gmail).
    - **Auth config** — OAuth or API key configuration for a toolkit so Flowra can call that service on your behalf.
    - **Connected account** — A user’s OAuth connection to a third-party service (e.g. their Slack or Google account), created via a link flow.
    - **Trigger** — A rule that runs a workflow on a schedule or when an event occurs.
    - **MCP** — Model Context Protocol; allows MCP clients (e.g. Cursor, Claude Desktop) to use your project’s tools and context.

## Who is it for?

Flowra is for **developers** and **teams** who want to:

- Build AI agents that use real tools (send emails, update sheets, call APIs).
- Automate workflows across multiple services without writing and maintaining every integration.
- Expose their tools and workflows to MCP clients (e.g. Cursor, Claude Desktop).
- Use one platform for auth, tools, triggers, and execution instead of stitching many services together.

## How it works at a high level

1. **Create a project** in the [Flowra Dashboard](https://flowra.dev) and get an **API key**.
2. **Configure auth** — Create [auth configs](/guides/auth-configs) (OAuth or API keys) for the toolkits you need (e.g. Slack, Google).
3. **Connect accounts** — Use [connected accounts](/guides/connected-accounts) so users can link their Slack, Google, etc. via OAuth.
4. **Use tools** — [List and search tools](/guides/tools-catalog) via the API, then [execute](/guides/tools) them with the right auth and inputs.
5. **Run workflows and agents** — In the dashboard you build workflows and agents that use these tools; you can trigger them via [triggers](/guides/triggers) or the API where supported.
6. **Optional: MCP** — Configure an [MCP server](/guides/mcp) so Cursor, Claude, or other MCP clients can call your project’s tools.

The API covers users, tools, auth configs, trigger instances, connected accounts, LLM generation, and MCP. The dashboard adds visual workflow editing, agent design, and a searchable tools catalog.
