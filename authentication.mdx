## Overview

Flowra API endpoints that support API key authentication accept your project API key via header. Create and manage keys in the dashboard under **Project → API Keys**.

## API key authentication

Send your API key in one of these ways:

### Option 1: x-api-key header (recommended)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://flowra.dev/api/v1/users/profile" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Option 2: Authorization Bearer

```bash
curl -X GET "https://flowra.dev/api/v1/users/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual project API key.

## Which endpoints use API keys?

Endpoints that support API key auth are marked in the [API reference](/api-reference). They use the `x-api-key` security scheme. Examples:

- **Users** — `GET /api/v1/users/profile`
- **Tools** — list, get by ID, execute, execution logs
- **Auth configs** — list, create, get, update, delete
- **Trigger instances** — list, upsert, manage status
- **Connected accounts** — list, link, get, delete
- **LLM** — `POST /api/v1/llm/generate`
- **MCP** — MCP-related endpoints

Other endpoints (for example login/register) may use different auth (e.g. session or OAuth) and are not covered by the API key flow above.

## Security

<Warning>
  **Do not expose API keys.** Do not commit them to version control, log them, or send them from client-side or public apps. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

<Note>
  If you need to rotate a key, create a new key in the dashboard, update your app, then revoke the old key.
