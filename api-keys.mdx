## Where to create API keys

1. Open the [Flowra Dashboard](https://flowra.dev).
2. Sign in and select your **project** (or create one).
3. Go to **Project → API Keys** (or **Settings → API Keys** in your project).
4. Click **Create API key**, give it a name (e.g. "Production" or "Docs testing"), and copy the key.

<Info>
  API keys are scoped to a project. Each project has its own keys. You won’t see the full key again after creation — store it securely.
</Info>

## Using your key

Use the key in the **x-api-key** header or as **Authorization: Bearer &lt;key&gt;** when calling the API. See [Authentication](/authentication) for examples.

## Best practices

- **One key per environment** — Use separate keys for development, staging, and production.
- **Descriptive names** — Name keys so you know where they’re used (e.g. "CI", "Backend prod").
- **Rotate regularly** — Create a new key, update your app, then revoke the old one.
- **Revoke if exposed** — If a key is leaked, revoke it in the dashboard immediately and create a new one.
