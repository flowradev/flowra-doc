## Overview

Trigger instances define when and how workflows or automations run (e.g. on a schedule or an event). The API lets you create/update trigger instances, list active ones, and enable/disable or delete them.

## Get active trigger instances

**GET** `/api/v1/trigger_instances/active` returns active trigger instances with optional filters and pagination.

| Query parameter | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `connectedAccountIds` | Filter by connected account IDs |
| `authConfigIds` | Filter by auth config IDs |
| `trigger_ids`, `trigger_ids` (legacy) | Filter by trigger IDs |
| `trigger_names`, `triggerNames` (legacy) | Filter by trigger names |
| `showDisabled` | Include disabled triggers |
| `page`, `limit`, `cursor` | Pagination |

## Upsert trigger instance

**POST** `/api/v1/trigger_instances/{slug}/upsert` creates or updates a trigger instance for the given `slug`. Request body: **UpsertTriggerInstanceDto** (see [API reference](/api-reference)). Use a stable slug to idempotently create or update the instance.

## Update trigger status (enable/disable)

**PATCH** `/api/v1/trigger_instances/manage/{triggerId}/status` enables or disables a trigger instance by ID. Send the desired status in the request body as defined in the API reference.

## Delete trigger instance

**DELETE** `/api/v1/trigger_instances/manage/{triggerId}` removes the trigger instance.
