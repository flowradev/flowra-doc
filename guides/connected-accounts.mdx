## Overview

Connected accounts represent a user’s OAuth connection to a third-party service (e.g. Slack, Google). You can list connected accounts, create link sessions so users can connect accounts, and get or delete a specific account.

## List connected accounts

**GET** `/api/v1/connected_accounts` returns paginated connected accounts with filters.

| Query parameter | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `toolkitSlugs` | Filter by toolkit slugs |
| `statuses` | Filter by status (e.g. `ACTIVE`, `FAILED`) |
| `authConfigIds` | Filter by auth config IDs |
| `connectedAccountIds` | Filter by connected account IDs |
| `eUIDs` | Filter by external user IDs |
| `labels` | Filter by labels |
| `orderBy` | `createdAt` or `updatedAt` |
| `orderDirection` | `asc` or `desc` |
| `cursor`, `limit` | Pagination (default limit 10) |

## Create link session

**POST** `/api/v1/connected_accounts/link` creates a new auth link session. Users open the returned URL to complete OAuth and connect their account. Request body: **CreateConnectedAccountLinkDto** (see [API reference](/api-reference)).

## Get and delete

- **GET** `/api/v1/connected_accounts/{nanoid}` — Get one connected account by ID.
- **DELETE** `/api/v1/connected_accounts/{nanoid}` — Remove the connected account.
